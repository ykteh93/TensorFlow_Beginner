# TensorFlow_Beginner
Classifying handwritten digit with MNIST dataset

This project is to understand the foundation of forward and backward propagation of neural network.

<br> &nbsp;
<br> &nbsp;
There are two versions in this repository:

<dl>
  <dt> 1. With TensorFlow implementation:</dt>
  <dd> This is similar to the tutorial provided at the official website of TensorFlow.</dd>
  
   <dt> 2. Without Tensorflow implementation:</dt>
  <dd> This is the exact equivalent but using only numpy to understand the chain-rule derivative in backward propagation.</dd>
</dl>


The required library:
* TensorFlow
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
