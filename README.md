This project is to understand the foundation of forward and backward propagation of neural network.
<br />
<br />
There are two versions in this repository:

1. With TensorFlow implementation:

  * This is similar to the tutorial provided at the official website of TensorFlow

2. Without Tensorflow implementation: 

  * This is the exact equivalent but with using only numpy

<br />
<br />
The required library:
* TensorFlow
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
