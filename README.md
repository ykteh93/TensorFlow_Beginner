# TensorFlow_Beginner
Classifying handwritten digit with MNIST dataset

This project is to understand the foundation of forward and backward propagation of neural network.


There are two versions in this repository:

1. With TensorFlow implementation:

this is similar to the tutorial provided at the official website of TensorFlow

2. Without Tensorflow implementation: 

this is the exact equivalent but with using only numpy



The required library:
* TensorFlow
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
