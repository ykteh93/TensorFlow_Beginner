# TensorFlow_Beginner
Classifying handwritten digit with MNIST dataset

This project is to understand the foundation of forward and backward propagation of neural network.
  
There are two versions in this repository:

<dl>
  <dt>1. With TensorFlow implementation:</dt>
  <dd>This is similar to the tutorial provided at the official website of TensorFlow</dd>
</dl>

1. With TensorFlow implementation:

  * This is similar to the tutorial provided at the official website of TensorFlow

2. Without Tensorflow implementation: 

  * This is the exact equivalent but with using only numpy


The required library:
* TensorFlow
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
